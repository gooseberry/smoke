At the bottom right, click on the time. Click on the settings Icon . Expand the Advanced option and click on Developers Next to Linux development environment, Click on Turn On. Follow the steps on the screen. Tip The default space setting for LDE is 10G. You may need more hard drive space if you intend to install many games. Install Ansible The script requires to have a recent build of Ansible, so we'll use PIP (Python Package Manager). You can choose to install this package automatically via a script, or manually enter each command, both options are listed below. Warning Smoke uses a collection of tools that will automatically install a number of tools inside the Linux Environment of ChromeOS. When you run one of the install scripts, it can make changes to the Linux Environment without asking your permission first. This can have adverse effects on some of the other Linux programs you may have aleady installed. Automatic install Manual Install Copy and paste the following line into the terminal to download and run a setup script that will install Ansible and clone the Smoke repository for you. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooseberry/smoke/main/setup.sh | bash Follow these steps if you prefer to complete the configuration manually by entering each command into the terminal.

Smoke isn't for everyone and if you're not sure about using this option, this section lists out some other solutions that you can explore before digging in. Tip You're not stuck using any one solution. You can try a combination of one or many of these alternatives to have the best solution that works for you. All these options below are worth trying out. Lutris Lutris has become a very popular option on Linux. It can be installed on Chromebooks through the Linux environment and works very well. Advantages Community driven installers give multiple options to install games Huge list of supported games means you will probably find an installer regardless of which game you are looking for. Well documented installation process helps users through the majority of problems Integration with GOG and other gaming services means you don't need to manually download games. Install scripts can be modified to suit your liking Challenges It can be tricky to find the right installation script that will work on Chromebook given that some games have multiple options. Users are required to install dependencies to get the installers to work. Installing a client to manage your libraries may turn some people off the project. Minigalaxy Minigalaxy describes itself as a Simple GOG client for Linux. Again, this platform is installed through the Linux environment. Advantages Automatically download and install games from your GOG library. Appears to work well for most games Challenges Installing a client to manage your library may turn some people off the project. Project supported through Debian repository means that updates and changes to this project may not make it to your system without some extra work on your part. Adamhm Scripts Adamhm is an active user in the GOG.com community who has authored countless install scripts to get Windows based games from GOG.com to run on Linux. Advantages Tested scripts that setup a Wine Prefix for each game. No knowledge of Wine or ProtonDB required to get these running. Adamhm is an active member of the GOG Forum and will offer assistance of fixes quickly. Challenges Limited to Windows games. You won't find any scripts from Adamhm for DOSBox or ScummVM games. If you're not comfortable with running commands on the terminal, you might not like this option. play.it play.it is another great source of scripts to help you get your GOG.com games installed on Linux based systems. This one works by creating a package installer (.deb) that you can use to install the game through the ChromeOS installer. This project most closely resembles Smoke in terms of goals and approach. Advantages Scripts create a portable installer; once you have the resulting .deb file, you can install the game onto your system quickly without re-creating the installer. Active development. Changes and fixes are being published on a regular basis. Challenges ChromeOS not officially supported. Some games may not work without additional modifications. Gamehub Gamehub is another launcher / installer combination program. This one also includes support for retro-console emulation. Some forums will report that Gamehub's install scripts don't always work. Manual Installs ChromeOS apps to check out If you're exploring manual installations, it's worth noting that there are some excellent game engine ports on the Google play store that are more than capable of handling some games where you don't even need to turn on Linux on your Chromebook.
